# Nanog
Full data analysis of Nanog project.

As we move towards differentiation from pluripotency, there is a dismantling of the pluripotent
gene network, leading to formation of more specialized cells through the expression of lineage
specific genes and developmental pathways. New studies suggest that pluripotent transcription
factors, beyond their role in stem cell maintenance, also have roles to play in cell fate decisions.
(Bony De Kumar et al., 2016) proposed a model of mutual repression of Nanog and Hoxa1 in
which both transcription factors bind to similar target genes to maintain the balance between
pluripotency and differentiation. (Maria Tiana et al., 2022) have also shown that Oct4 is
necessary for the activation of HoxB genes during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells
and in the embryo. These studies support the hypothesis of pluripotent factors having roles
other than maintenance of pluripotency, in other words establishing a dual role of pluripotent
factors.
