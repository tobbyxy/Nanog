# Understanding Nanog's role during cell differentiation: Master's Thesis
Pluripotency is characterized by the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into
all cell types. This state relies on both extrinsic factors, such as leukemia inhibitory
factor and bone morphogenetic protein, and intrinsic factors, including pluripotent
transcription factors.
While the role of pluripotent transcription factors in stem cell maintenance is well
understood, their functions beyond pluripotency remain unclear. In this study, we
focused on NANOG, a core member of the pluripotency network, and investigated its
roles in two different models of differentiation: the transition from the naive to the primed
pluripotent state and neuroectodermal differentiation.


## Preview

Our questions were:

1. What is Nanog specific role during differentiation
2. What is responsible for the possible changing role of Nanog

Here we have combined multi omics datasets to answer our questions.

## Datasets

1. RNA-Seq [gse138818](https://journals.biologists.com/bio/article/8/11/bio046367/222814/Nanog-regulates-Pou3f1-expression-at-the-exit-from)
2. ChIP-Seq [gse71932](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16480)
3. ATAC-Seq [E-MTAB-7207](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(19)30637-0)


## Data Visualization / Quality check

To see if all the samples are appropriate for downstream analysis we perform some transformation using distance matrix and pca.
